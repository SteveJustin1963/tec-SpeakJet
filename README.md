# tec-SpeakJet

We can integrate a simple talking circuit using a Speakjet chip by Magnevation into the TEC-1 device. This chip allows for pre-recording of sounds and phrases which can be played back when prompted by a switch or input/output activation. Similar to a tickle me elmo toy, the circuit will require an amplifier and speaker, in addition to the Speakjet chip, to play back the sounds at an audible level.

To program the sounds on the SpeakJet chip, it is necessary to connect the circuit to a computer via a DB9 connector and use the Max232 chip to convert the signals to the correct levels. The SpeakJet chip has a variety of built-in sounds, including speech elements, sound effects, musical notes and touch tones which can be mixed and matched to produce various sounds, phrases and musical tones. It is possible to use pre-made sounds or create your own. The SpeakJet homepage by Magnevation has more information on programming and samples of the chip. The SpeakJet datasheet/manual is also available for reference.

Once the sounds have been programmed on the SpeakJet chip, the circuit can be activated by pressing any of the tactile switches (S1, S2, and S3). The programmed sounds will play depending on the switch pressed. The circuit can be enclosed in any toy and the tactile switches can be placed in different parts of the toy to activate different sounds
